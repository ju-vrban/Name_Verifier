# Name Verifier


## Descrition
Name verifier is a console application that reads the entries from a text file, and checks their correctness. The user specifies the file location, and the entries should be formatted like this: DD.MM.YYYY Name Surname. The following entries are also correct, DD.MM.YYYY Name Name Surname Surname, and DD.MM.YYYY Name-Name Surname-Surname.
